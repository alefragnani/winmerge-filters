# WinMerge Filters

My custom WinMerge Filters

_I'm keeping it here because I want to have it synced between different machines._

## Available Filters

* **Embarcadero Delphi** projects
* **Visual Studio Code** extensions

## Installation

* Clone the repo 
```
  git clone https://github.com/alefragnani/winmerge-filters.git
```
* Open WinMerge
* Open a new compare window `File / Open`
* Click `Select...` button to select a filter
* Click `Install...` button and locate the cloned folder
* Select a filter, and click `Open`.
* Repeat the two steps above for each filter in the cloned folder

After that, you should see all the filters in the filters list.
